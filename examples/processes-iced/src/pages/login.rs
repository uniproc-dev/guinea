//! A form, which is the shape Elm is best at and the one this framework had
//! nothing to show yet.
//!
//! Everything on it is the page's own: two fields being typed into are no
//! business of the domain, and no actor is involved until there is something
//! to submit. So there is no reducer here at all - the page is its state, and
//! `update` is the only place it changes.
//!
//! It accepts anything: this demonstrates the form, not authentication.
