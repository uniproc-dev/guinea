//! The page that minds being left - and the one that proves a view may borrow.
//!
//! `text_editor` keeps a `&Content` for the life of the element, so this page
//! is only expressible because a view is `View<'_, Msg>` borrowed from the
//! node rather than something the node had to hand over by value. The node
//! lives in the shell for exactly that reason; see [`guinea::iced::Nodes`].
//!
//! `leaving` is the guard: a method on the node, answered from the node's own
//! state, because on the way out the state exists and is the only thing that
//! knows whether there is anything to lose. Entering is the asymmetric case -
//! there is nothing to read yet - which is why an enter guard belongs in the
//! route declaration instead.
//!
//! Switching tabs with something typed here puts the question up. The
//! navigation is parked, not cancelled: nothing has been torn down, so
//! answering "Discard" finishes the move that was already asked for, and
//! switching to a third tab while the question is open replaces it.
