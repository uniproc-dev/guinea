//! The same shape of feature, with no actor in it - and nothing outside can
//! tell.
//!
//! This exists to hold the boundary honest. An actor is one way for a domain
//! to run its logic; the framework must not make it the only way, and the way
//! to check that is to write a feature without one. Here the state is an
//! ordinary `Rc<RefCell<_>>` on the UI thread, actions are answered by a
//! closure, and the domain schedules its own work with a timer - no mailbox,
//! no `Handler`, no `Addr`.
//!
//! What the UI sees is identical to `processes`: a reducer to read and
//! `dispatch.emit(Refresh)` to act. It named no actor before and there is none
//! to name now, which is the whole claim.
