//! What caused what.
//!
//! Every observable point - an action from the UI, a message sent to an actor,
//! its handling, background work and its result, a publication and each of its
//! deliveries, a reducer update, a navigation - is a [`Record`] with an id and
//! the id of the point that caused it. Following `parent` from any record
//! gives its provenance; following it the other way gives everything it set
//! off.
//!
//! The cause is carried implicitly on the thread ([`current`]) and explicitly
//! wherever work crosses a queue or a thread: an actor's mailbox, a background
//! task, a hop back onto the UI thread. [`Cause`] is `Copy + Send` for that.
//!
//! Records go to the observers on the thread that produced them (devtools),
//! and to `tracing` as one event each: the target names the kind of point,
//! `guinea::send`, and the fields carry `id`, `parent` and what the point
//! holds. `guinea::tick=off` silences one kind. [`json`] writes them, and the
//! application's own events with the point they happened under, as JSON
//! lines.
