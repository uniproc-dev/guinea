//! Guards on the way in.
//!
//! The asymmetry with leaving is what decides where each is declared. On the
//! way out the scope exists, so a guard can read its own state - which is what
//! "unsaved changes" is - and that is why leave guards register during
//! `install`. On the way in there is nothing to read yet: the guard has to
//! answer *before* anything is installed, or a refused navigation would leave
//! a half-built tree behind. So an enter guard is part of the route
//! declaration, and what it may read is what the application holds rather than
//! what the route does.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! struct RequiresAdmin;
//!
//! impl Enter for RequiresAdmin {
//!     fn decide(cx: &EnterCx<'_>) -> Verdict {
//!         match cx.require::<Session>() {
//!             Some(session) if session.is_admin() => Verdict::Allow,
//!             _ => Verdict::Block,
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```ignore
//! routes! {
//!     Route {
//!         layout(AdminArea) guard(RequiresAdmin) {
//!             page(Audit) link("/admin/audit")
//!             page(Public) !guard(RequiresAdmin) link("/admin/public")
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `guard` cascades, because it tightens; opting out has to name what it
//! opens, so that removing protection reads as removing protection.
