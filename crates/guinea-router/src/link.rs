//! What a deep link is allowed to carry.
//!
//! A path used to decode with `FromStr` and encode with `Display`, which meant
//! any type in reach could sit in a link. That is too much freedom for the one
//! part of an application that is not the application's to change: once
//! shipped, an address lives in shortcuts, in mails, and in other programs'
//! integrations, and it has to mean the same thing to an installer, to the
//! next version, and to whoever typed it.
//!
//! So the set is closed, and closed with a sealed trait rather than a list of
//! names inside the macro. The macro sees tokens; `type Context = String`
//! would fail a textual check and passes this one, because at the type level
//! it really is a `String`.
//!
//! Closing it also makes encoding fixable. `Display` for a `String` puts `/`
//! and spaces straight into the path, so a capture of `"a/b"` used to build a
//! link that read as two segments. [`LinkValue::encode`] percent-encodes and
//! [`LinkValue::decode`] undoes it; with an open `Display` there was nowhere
//! to put that.
//!
//! The rule binds captures of a route that declared a `link`, and nothing
//! else. A route with no address is ordinary Rust and its fields are whatever
//! the author wants.
