//! Routes that survive a restart.
//!
//! The tier that makes the compiler prove something. `link` says an address
//! exists; `restorable` says the route can be rebuilt from text alone, and the
//! generated code is the proof - a field that cannot make the round trip fails
//! to build at its own declaration.
//!
//! What is deliberately absent is storage. The router hands over a string and
//! takes one back; where it lives between runs is the application's business,
//! the same way drawing is the backend's.
