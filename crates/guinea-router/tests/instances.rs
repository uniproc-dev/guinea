//! Two instances of one feature in one scope.
//!
//! Reducers survive this on their own: `List<Recent>` and `List<Archived>` are
//! different types, so the scope's cells never collide. Actions do not - one
//! `Refresh` type, two features that answer it - and a scope keyed by the
//! action alone would let whichever installed last answer for both.
//!
//! Which is why a scope is not a flat map: each installed feature gets its own
//! section, and the dispatcher a reader is handed belongs to the section that
//! owns what it was reading.
