//! A route carrying something with no identity.
//!
//! The router asks one question about a parameter: is this still the same one?
//! For a channel, a callback, an `Arc<dyn Trait>` there is no answer - they
//! have an address and nothing else - and answering it anyway is what forces
//! `PartialEq` onto a payload that has no business implementing it.
//!
//! `~` says the question does not apply. The value still reaches `install`; it
//! is simply never compared and never kept, so the router cannot claim two
//! entries are the same and reinstalls every time.
