//! Where a reducer's change becomes a redraw - after the turn that made it.
//!
//! [`Scope::push`](crate::scope::Scope::push) applies the update and marks the
//! cell. The listeners run when the current *turn* ends: a turn is one delivery
//! of messages to an actor, or, when nothing opened one, the push itself.
//!
//! The unit is deliberately the turn and not the frame. Tying it to a frame
//! makes the delay a property of the backend - the next tick under an
//! immediate-mode toolkit, whenever the loop wakes under a retained one - and
//! a page author cannot say when their change lands. Tying it to the turn puts
//! the drain microseconds later, in the same place on every backend.
//!
//! Two things follow. The actor loop and the drawing loop stop sharing a
//! stack: the listeners run after `handle` returned, so navigating or dropping
//! a scope from one cannot pull the ground from under an actor that is still
//! running. And a burst of pushes inside one turn costs one notification per
//! cell rather than one per push, because marks are deduplicated.
