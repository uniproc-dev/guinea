//! The two halves of a reducer's traffic, and the one call that wires them.
//!
//! What this replaces is four ways of saying the same thing. Ownership of a
//! reducer used to be a side effect of which of `port`, `actions`, `wire` or
//! `seed_reducer` a feature happened to call, and the two ends of one edge -
//! "this actor drives this reducer" and "this action goes to that actor" -
//! were declared in different places. A member nobody wired warned at runtime
//! instead of failing to build.
//!
//! Here the pair is known by construction. [`Claim::driven_by`] creates the
//! actor from the very expression that claims the reducer, and hands the
//! closure its [`Push`] as a parameter - so the direction is named where it is
//! used rather than in the name of a method that fetches it. Nothing is left
//! to wire, so nothing can be left unwired.
