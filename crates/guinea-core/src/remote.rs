//! Actions and events a tool can send from outside, as JSON.
//!
//! Always compiled, and empty until something is registered. A type opts in
//! with `#[derive(guinea::Remote)]` and says which it is -
//! `#[remote(action)]`, `#[remote(event)]` or both - and the derive registers
//! it here. Nothing is reachable by default: what an agent may do to a
//! running application is what its author listed.
//!
//! A type is sent by its short name, `Sort`, or by its path,
//! `app::processes::Sort`. Two pages may each have a `Sort`: the short name
//! means whichever one the open page answers, and only when two would answer
//! in one place does it take the path to say which.
//!
//! An action goes to whichever scope answers it, the way a page's
//! [`Dispatch`](crate::feature::Dispatch) would send it; an event goes out on
//! the global bus as if it had arrived on the UI thread. Either is one
//! [`Point::Action`](crate::trace::Point::Action), and its id is handed back,
//! so what it set off can be followed in the trace.
