//! The windows-reactor backend: what a segment is, how it is mounted, and what
//! it reads state through.
//!
//! Rewritten for the component model, and rewritten the same way the iced
//! adapter is written - because they are now the same kind of thing. The PR
//! that replaced the render-and-hook API says so in its own words: *state lives
//! in structs, events are enums*. That is Elm, and guinea already had an Elm
//! backend.
//!
//! So a page here looks like a page there. The struct that implements [`Page`]
//! **is** the page's state; it has a `Message` of its own, one `update` that is
//! the only place it changes, and a `view` that borrows it. What differs is
//! only what a view returns and how an event reaches the node - owned `View`
//! and a `Callback` here, a borrowed `Element` and a mapped message there.
