//! guinea on ratatui: the same router and features, drawn in a terminal.
//!
//! The interesting difference from the WinUI backend is what a view *is*.
//! WinUI is retained: a view builds an element tree and hands it over.
//! ratatui is immediate: a view draws into a frame that only exists during
//! one pass, and nothing survives it. So here a view is neither of those - it
//! is a [`Node`], a piece of drawing deferred until someone supplies a frame
//! and an area.
//!
//! That indirection is what lets a layout place its child. `mount` receives
//! only [`SegmentProps`], never a frame, so a node cannot draw when it is
//! built; by the time the frame exists the layout has decided the geometry and
//! passes down whatever rectangle it wants the page to occupy.
