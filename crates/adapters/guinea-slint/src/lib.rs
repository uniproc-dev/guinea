//! guinea on Slint: the same router and features, in a tree Slint compiled.
//!
//! The other two backends hand the router a view: WinUI an element tree,
//! ratatui a piece of deferred drawing. Slint hands it nothing. Its tree is
//! declared in `.slint` and compiled, and a component written in Rust cannot
//! be embedded into another one at runtime - `ComponentContainer` exists, but
//! the code generator answers `todo!("Components written in Rust can not get
//! embedded yet")`, so a factory's product ends up in the window without ever
//! being joined to the tree above it. It looks like it works until a second
//! page is mounted and the item indices start to overlap.
//!
//! So here a segment renders nothing: `View = ()`. The whole tree exists from
//! the start, with the pages in it, and the route decides which branch is
//! alive - a `.slint` conditional, which Slint creates and destroys on its
//! own. What the router still does is everything it does elsewhere: install
//! the features a route needs, own their scopes, and tear them down on the way
//! out.
//!
//! State reaches the tree through globals, one per page, declared beside the
//! component that reads them. A global is a singleton, so a binding made when
//! the page was installed survives the branch being destroyed and rebuilt -
//! which is exactly what happens every time the route changes.
