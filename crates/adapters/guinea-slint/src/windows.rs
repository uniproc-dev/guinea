//! The window contract, over Slint's own.
//!
//! Slint answers almost all of it directly - size, position, maximised,
//! fullscreen, visible, close - which is why the contract was written by
//! looking at winit and Slint rather than at the poorest backend.
//!
//! What Slint does not have is *notice*: there is no callback for "the window
//! was resized" or "the window moved". So changes are noticed by asking, on a
//! timer, and published only when the answer differs from the last one. Not
//! elegant, but honest and cheap - four getters, and the only party that would
//! care (something storing the geometry) has to debounce anyway.
