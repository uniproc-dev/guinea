//! Where a node lives, and why it is not in the scope.
//!
//! Everywhere else in guinea a segment's state sits in its `Scope`, behind an
//! `Rc<RefCell<_>>`, and every reader takes a snapshot. That works for four
//! backends because their views own everything they show.
//!
//! iced's do not. `text_editor` holds a `&Content` for the life of the
//! element, and a `Ref` taken out of an `Rc` clone dies at the end of the call
//! that took it - so no amount of lifetime plumbing makes a view built that
//! way outlive its own mounting. The state has to be somewhere that hands out
//! `&'a` for exactly the render, and the only such place is what iced itself
//! owns: the shell it passes to `view`.
//!
//! So the nodes live here, and the two things the scope was doing for them -
//! being replaced when a segment reinstalls, and being kept when a page asked
//! to keep its state - are done here too, by the same rules the router uses
//! for the reducers it still owns.
