//! guinea on iced: Elm inside a node, actors between nodes.
//!
//! The other four backends are told what to draw and have no opinion about
//! where a click goes. iced does: it is Elm, so every interaction is a value
//! of one `Message` type that comes back to one `update`. That is the whole
//! reason this adapter exists - it is the one that has to say what happens
//! when a route tree of independent nodes meets a toolkit that wants a single
//! message type at the top.
//!
//! The answer is that a node keeps its own `State`, its own `Message` and its
//! own `update`, all on the one trait that puts it in the route tree, and
//! nothing above it ever names any of them. A parent does not wrap a child's
//! messages, so adding a page costs no edit anywhere else - the composition
//! tax Elm normally charges (a variant, a match arm, a `map`, per child, per
//! level) is not paid at all. What the toolkit sees is [`Envelope`]: an opaque
//! carrier holding the message, the node's own delivery function, and where in
//! the chain that node sits.
//!
//! What is left over is the part Elm has no answer for: two pieces of state
//! that reference each other rather than nest - a selected row and a list an
//! actor replaces. That is `cx.on`, and it is a translation, not a mutation:
//! it turns what happened elsewhere into this node's own message, so there is
//! still exactly one place the node's state changes.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[page]
//! impl Page for Processes {
//!     type Params = ProcessesParams;
//!     type Message = Msg;
//!
//!     fn observes(cx: &Observing<'_, Msg>) { cx.on::<ProcessesReducer>(list_replaced); }
//!     fn update(&mut self, message: Msg, cx: &mut UpdateCx<'_, Self>) { .. }
//!     fn view(&self, cx: &PageCx<'_, Self>) -> View<'_, Msg> { .. }
