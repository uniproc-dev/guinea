//! The one message type iced sees.
//!
//! iced wants a single `Message` at the top of the application; guinea has a
//! chain of nodes that each keep their own. The usual Elm bridge between those
//! two facts is for every parent to grow a variant per child and a `map` per
//! placement - the cost that makes an Elm tree expensive to rearrange.
//!
//! An envelope avoids it by carrying its own delivery: the message, the
//! function that knows how to apply it (monomorphised for the node that made
//! it, so the node type never has to be named anywhere else), and where in the
//! chain that node sat. Nothing between the widget and the node reads any of
//! it.
