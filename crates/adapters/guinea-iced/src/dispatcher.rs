//! Getting background work back onto the thread that draws - and getting iced
//! to ask for it.
//!
//! Every backend here has the same two halves: a queue that carries work to
//! the UI thread, and a way to wake the loop that drains it. What is different
//! about iced is that there is no place to reach in and drain. A terminal
//! polls, egui hands over the top of each frame, Slint has a rendering
//! notifier; iced only ever calls `update`, and only with a message.
//!
//! So the wake-up has to be a message. A subscription streams one in whenever
//! a worker queues something, `update` recognises it as nobody's message in
//! particular and drains the queue. That is the integration point, and it is
//! also why the queue itself stays thread-local: only the token crosses
//! threads, never the work.
