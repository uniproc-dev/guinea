//! Getting background work back onto the thread that draws - and waking it.
//!
//! Two halves, unlike the other backends. The queue is a channel drained
//! between frames, as in the terminal. The wake-up is the part egui adds:
//! it sleeps when nothing happens, so a task queued from a worker thread
//! would sit there until the user happened to move the mouse.
//! `Context::request_repaint` is what asks for one more frame, and it is
//! `Send`, which is the whole reason this works.
