//! Timers, owned by the context that set them up.
//!
//! An application's timers live as long as the application; a feature's, as
//! long as its scope. There is no timer without an owner: dropping what the
//! context holds stops it. Each remembers where it was set up, which is how
//! devtools tell one from another, and ticks on the UI thread.
//!
//! They wait on `tokio::time`, through the same executor as background work,
//! so they need the runtime `spawn_bg` needs - and under a test harness they
//! wait on the test's clock and tick when it is advanced.
