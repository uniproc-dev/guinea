//! Which roots are open.
//!
//! A *root* is one instance of an application's tree: its own [`FeatureHost`],
//! its own event bus, and - when there is routing - its own router and stack
//! of scopes. What is above it is the process: plugins, services, the global
//! scope, the global bus.
//!
//! That is the split guinea has always had; opening a second window is what
//! makes it visible. `bootstrap` guards installation per process, because
//! installing twice would open the store's database again, while the router is
//! created "one per component instance, not one per process" - so the second
//! window shares the services and gets scopes of its own.
//!
//! Deliberately not called a window. A terminal has one root and no window at
//! all; Slint's window is a component; Tauri has two levels, since one window
//! can hold several webviews and a root belongs to the webview. A window is
//! what a shell puts a root in, and guinea does not need to know.
//!
//! [`FeatureHost`]: crate::feature::FeatureHost
