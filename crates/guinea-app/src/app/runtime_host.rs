//! entered on the calling thread - and the thread that installs an application
//! is the UI thread, which nothing has entered. Every application therefore
//! opened with the same two lines before it could do anything:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let runtime = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()?;
//! let _guard = runtime.enter();
//! ```
//!
//! So guinea does it instead, unless the application already has a runtime of
//! its own.
